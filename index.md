> <h1 class="a-font">Hello world!</h1>
> <p class="b-font">I'm a research engineer at <a href="https://www.audinate.com/">Audinate</a> and a casual academic at <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering">UNSW CSE</a>.

> <p class="b-font">With the ongoing demand of processing throughput from big-data applications like machine learning and computational bioinformatics, designing domain-specific computing systems are important in order to keep up with the trend of data size. I am interested in the cross intersection of computer architecture and computer systems with the goal of improving the processing performance of systems. I like to get hands-on, and my work spans across hardware acceleration, embedded systems, operating systems, computer networks applied on cross disciplines such as bioinformatics and audio over IP.</p>
