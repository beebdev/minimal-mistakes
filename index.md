> # `Hello World!`
> I'm a research engineer at **[Audinate](https://www.audinate.com/)** and a casual academic at **[UNSW CSE](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering)**. I previously worked with **[Prof. Sri Parameswaran](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/sri-parameswaran.html)**, **[Dr. Hasindu Gamaarachchi](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/hasindu-gamaarachchi)** and **[Dr. Hassaan Saadat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hassaan-saadat-7947a3166/)** in the **[Embedded Systems Research Group](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering/our-research/research-groups/embedded-systems)** at UNSW Sydney.

> With the ongoing demand of processing throughput from big-data applications like machine learning and computational bioinformatics, designing domain-specific computing systems are important in order to keep up with the trend of data size. I am interested in the cross intersection of computer architecture and computer systems with the goal of improving the processing performance of systems. I like to get hands-on, and my work spans across hardware acceleration, embedded systems, operating systems, computer networks applied on cross disciplines such as bioinformatics and audio over IP.
